# Next.js 15 App Router: Missing Layout Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's App Router related to missing layouts.  In development, the code might appear to work correctly, but production builds can fail or produce unexpected results.

## The Bug
The problem arises when a page component in the App Router is not wrapped within a layout.  This omission can lead to unexpected rendering behaviors, including missing styles, data fetching issues, or component rendering errors.  The issue is particularly pronounced in production builds.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to see the seemingly correct development behavior.
4. Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` to observe the production errors or unexpected rendering.

## Solution
Ensure that all page components in your Next.js 15 App Router are properly nested within a layout component. This establishes the correct context for rendering and data fetching, ensuring consistent behavior across development and production environments.
