```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This code snippet seems simple and straightforward. However, in Next.js 15, if you're using App Router and forget to wrap this component with a layout, it might lead to unexpected behavior.  The page might render correctly in development mode, but during production builds, it might throw an error or render improperly. 

The issue is related to how the App Router handles layouts and page components. Without a layout, the component is not rendered within the expected context, potentially resulting in missing styles, missing functionality (like data fetching), or unexpected rendering issues.
